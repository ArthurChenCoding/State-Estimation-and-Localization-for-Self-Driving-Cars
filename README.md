# State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars

Implementation of the Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF) to localize a vehicle using data from the CARLA simulator, more specifically:
* A Model for typical vehicle localization sensors, including GPS and IMUs
* An application of extended and unscented Kalman Filters to a vehicle state estimation problem
* An application of LIDAR scan matching and the Iterative Closest Point algorithm
